# **Security**

## **Authentication:**
- **Password Encryption with bcrypt**:
  - Use `bcrypt` for hashing user passwords before storing them in the database. Choose a higher salt rounds value (e.g., 12 or 14) for stronger security.
  - Implement a mechanism to securely reset passwords and ensure strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, use of numbers and symbols).
  
- **HTTPS**:
  - Ensure all API endpoints and frontend traffic are served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data interception.
  
- **Google OAuth & WebAuthn Compliance**:
  - Use industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 for Google authentication and WebAuthn for passkey-based authentication to ensure security.
  - Keep user credentials minimal and securely manage tokens with proper expiry times.
  
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Set up rate-limiting on the login and registration endpoints to prevent brute force attacks. Use libraries like `express-rate-limit` or `nestjs-throttler` in NestJS.
  - Implement CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA) during login/registration processes to prevent automated attacks.

## **Data Protection:**
- **pgcrypto for Sensitive Fields**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data in the database (e.g., emails, addresses, or personal information) using `pgcrypto` or similar encryption libraries.
  - Store encryption keys securely using a dedicated key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).
  
- **Input Sanitization**:
  - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities using libraries like `validator` or `sanitize-html`.
  - Use ORM query builders (e.g., TypeORM with NestJS) which automatically prevent raw SQL injection risks.
  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  - Define a strong CSP header to protect against unauthorized scripts from loading on your pages. This can prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## **Access Control:**
- **Roles and Permissions**:
  - Define roles like `Admin`, `User`, and `Moderator`. Each role should have distinct permissions for accessing or modifying content.
  - Use a role-based access control (RBAC) system and ensure access control checks are in place on every sensitive API endpoint.
  
- **API Security with Guards**:
  - Implement NestJS guards to protect API routes. Use `RolesGuard` to ensure users can only access routes permitted for their role.
  
- **Access Logs & Monitoring**:
  - Implement logging of all access attempts (failed and successful) and store them securely. Review these logs regularly for unusual activity.
  - Use tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch for log aggregation and analysis.

## **Third-Party API Security:**
- **Secure API Keys**:
  - Store API keys for services like Twilio, Google OAuth, and Sentry in environment variables or encrypted secrets management tools.
  - Rotate API keys regularly and monitor for any unauthorized usage.
  
- **Monitoring for Abnormal Activities**:
  - Set up monitoring for unusual behavior from third-party APIs (e.g., an unusually high number of requests). You can use services like Datadog, Sentry, or custom alerts in Prometheus/Grafana.

# **Performance**

## **Client-Side Optimization:**
- **Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**:
  - Use ISR for pages that do not change frequently, such as community guidelines or localized posts. This can reduce server load and speed up page load times.
  
- **Asset Optimization**:
  - Minify and compress all CSS and JavaScript files during production builds to reduce the payload size and improve load times.
  - Use image optimization tools (e.g., `next/image` in Next.js) to serve appropriately sized images based on the device.
  
- **Service Workers for Offline Support**:
  - Implement service workers to cache key assets (e.g., posts, maps) for offline functionality. This ensures that the app remains usable even when the user loses network connectivity.

- **Lazy Loading for Map Tiles**:
  - Load map tiles from Leaflet lazily as the user interacts with the map to reduce initial load time. Use techniques like `React.lazy` for components.

## **Backend Optimization:**
- **Redis Caching**:
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed data like the most recent posts, popular locations, or user geolocation to reduce database load.
  
- **Database Query Optimization**:
  - Optimize PostgreSQL queries by indexing common fields (e.g., user IDs, post creation dates) and analyzing slow queries with tools like `pg_stat_statements`.
  - Use prepared statements to reduce query parsing overhead.
  
- **Connection Pooling**:
  - Implement connection pooling to manage database connections more efficiently. Use tools like `pg-pool` to handle high request volumes.

- **Asynchronous Service Calls**:
  - Use async processes for calls to third-party services (e.g., Twilio, geolocation APIs) to avoid blocking critical backend operations.

## **Monitoring & Observability**:
- **Sentry for Performance Issues**:
  - Track client-side and server-side performance using Sentry to capture slow requests or unhandled exceptions.
  
- **Prometheus & Grafana**:
  - Set up Prometheus to collect metrics like API response times, memory usage, and errors. Visualize these with Grafana dashboards.
  - Set up alerts for thresholds like high response times or database connection issues.

# **Usability**

## **UI/UX Design:**
- **Responsive UI with TailwindCSS**:
  - Use TailwindCSS to ensure a responsive layout that adapts well to various screen sizes, making it easy for users to navigate the app on mobile devices.
  
- **Error Messages**:
  - Provide clear and friendly error messages (e.g., "Unable to load your location. Please try again.") that guide users to resolve issues without frustration.

- **Autocomplete Features**:
  - Implement autocomplete features for forms (e.g., address fields) to enhance the user experience. Use Google Places API for accurate location suggestions.

## **Localization:**
- **Next.js i18n for Multi-Language Support**:
  - Use Next.js's internationalization (i18n) capabilities to provide support for multiple languages, ensuring the app is accessible to a global audience.
  - Implement language-switching functionality that allows users to change their language without reloading the page.

## **Accessibility:**
- **ARIA Roles for Components**:
  - Ensure that key components like maps, forms, and chat windows have proper ARIA roles and attributes to make the app accessible to screen readers.
  
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Ensure that all interactive elements, like buttons, forms, and chat, are navigable via the keyboard.

- **Color Contrast and WCAG Compliance**:
  - Ensure that color contrast meets WCAG standards (AA or AAA) for users with visual impairments. Use automated tools like the WAVE tool or Lighthouse to check compliance.

# **Compliance**

## **Privacy & Data Protection**:
- **Privacy Policy**:
  - Clearly explain the types of data collected, such as geolocation, in the privacy policy. Ensure that users are informed before collection begins.
  
- **Cookie Consent**:
  - Implement a consent mechanism for cookies and data tracking. Ensure that users can accept or reject non-essential cookies.

## **Authentication Standards**:
- **WebAuthn Compliance**:
  - Ensure WebAuthn passkey authentication follows FIDO2 standards for user authentication, providing a secure and passwordless login experience.
  
- **Session Management**:
  - Allow users to review and revoke active sessions in the user account settings, giving them full control over their login devices.

## **Data Retention Policies**:
- **Automatic Deletion of Data**:
  - Implement automatic deletion policies for sensitive data like chat logs, ensuring that old or irrelevant data is removed from the system periodically.
  
- **Data Minimization**:
  - Retain sensitive user data (e.g., geolocation) only for as long as necessary. Use pseudonymization where possible to enhance privacy.

# **Testing**

## **Unit Testing**:
- **Backend Business Logic**:
  - Use Jest to write unit tests for backend logic, especially for complex actions like creating posts, verifying geolocation, or managing user roles.

- **Mocking External Services**:
  - Mock third-party services (e.g., Twilio, Google OAuth) during tests to ensure that the unit tests are isolated and focus on your business logic.

## **Component Testing**:
- **UI Testing with RTL**:
  - Use React Testing Library (RTL) to write tests for your UI components, ensuring they render correctly and function as expected.

- **Mocking Leaflet Maps**:
  - Mock Leaflet components in tests to avoid dependencies on external services and ensure that the map functionality is tested without actual geospatial data.

## **End-to-End Testing**:
- **Cypress for Full Workflows**:
  - Use Cypress to test complete user workflows like logging in, posting content, and interacting with the chat system. Ensure critical paths are automated and verified.
  
- **Automated Critical Scenarios**:
  - Automate testing for important user actions, such as submitting emergency posts or changing location preferences.
