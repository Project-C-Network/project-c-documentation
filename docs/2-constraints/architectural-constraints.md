# Constraints in Architectural Design

Architects must have a clear understanding of the areas where they have creative freedom in their design choices and where they are bound by constraints. These constraints must be addressed comprehensively, as they are non-negotiable factors within the project.

## Key Points:
- **Creative Freedom**: The aspects of the project where architects can explore innovative and unique design solutions.
- **Constraints**: Rigid factors such as regulatory, structural, environmental, or budgetary limitations that must be adhered to during the project.

| **Constraint**      | **Explanation**                                                                                 |

| **Documentation**   | To keep it clean, efficient, and simple, it will follow the Arc42 method and be deployed for anytime access. |
| **Deployment**      | The project must be deployed whenever a release is made.                                       |
| **Testing**         | Ensure good unit test coverage (80%+) and acceptance testing covering all web app functionality. |
