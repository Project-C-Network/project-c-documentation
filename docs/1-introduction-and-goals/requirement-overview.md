### 1.2 Quality Goals

| Goal              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Usability**     | Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use for all demographics. Include clear navigation, user-friendly forms, and accessible help documentation. Comply with WCAG for inclusivity. |
| **Performance**   | Ensure fast response times for core functionalities like issue reporting and map loading. Maintain a system capable of handling high concurrent user traffic without performance degradation. Optimize resource utilization through caching and efficient database queries. |
| **Reliability**   | Achieve high availability with minimal downtime (target uptime of 99.9% or higher). Implement error handling to manage unexpected failures gracefully. Use automated failover and backup systems to recover quickly from outages. |
| **Scalability**   | Design the system to scale horizontally and vertically as user demand increases. Ensure microservices can scale independently to handle specific workloads. Optimize API endpoints for efficient data handling. |
| **Security**      | Protect sensitive user data with encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. Implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, MFA). Regularly audit the system for vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly. |
| **Maintainability** | Follow clean code principles and consistent coding standards across all components. Ensure detailed documentation for APIs, microservices, and system workflows. Use automated CI/CD pipelines for updates with minimal manual intervention. |
| **Interoperability** | Ensure the application can integrate with third-party services like mapping APIs and payment gateways. Provide well-documented and secure RESTful APIs for external integrations. Use open standards for data exchange to promote compatibility. |
| **Testability**   | Achieve high test coverage for all critical components, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Automate regression testing to identify and resolve issues quickly. Use mock services and data to simulate real-world conditions during testing. |
| **Localization**  | Support multiple languages to cater to diverse user bases. Ensure consistent formatting for dates, currencies, and other locale-specific content. Test translations for accuracy and cultural appropriateness. |
| **Compliance**    | Adhere to data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Ensure compliance with local laws and standards for social media and content moderation. Provide users with clear terms of service and privacy policies. |
| **User Engagement** | Provide timely notifications and updates to keep users informed. Enable interactive features like voting, commenting, and sharing. Use analytics to understand user behavior and improve features. |
| **Extensibility** | Design microservices to allow for easy addition of new features without significant changes to the existing codebase. Ensure APIs are versioned to support future enhancements without breaking existing integrations. Maintain modularity for easier replacement or upgrading of components. |
